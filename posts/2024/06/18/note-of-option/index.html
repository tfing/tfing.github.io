      <h1 id="whats-option">What&rsquo;s Option <a href="#whats-option" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Option is a contract that derivated from the underlying stock.
It gives the contract buyer the right to buy or sell the stock at a certain price before a certain date.
the certain price is called &lsquo;strike price&rsquo;.
the certin date is called &rsquo;expiration date&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If user A buys a contract with the right to buy the stock from user B, user A can decide when to execute the contract before expiration date.
If user A decides to execute the right to buy stocks, user B is obligated to sell the stocks to user A at the strike price.
the buy action of user A is called &rsquo;exercise&rsquo;.
the sell action of user B is called &lsquo;assignment&rsquo;.</p>
<p>the situation is similar for the sell right.
The user A has the right to sell the stock to user B at the strike price.
The user B is obligated to buy the stock at the strike price.</p>
<p>Hence, there are 2 types of options. &lsquo;call option&rsquo; for the right to buy and &lsquo;put option&rsquo; for the right to sell.</p>
<p>the term to say the buyer/seller of options are,
Long: buyer of options. long call and long put.
Short: seller of options. short call and short put.</p>
<p>The price to buy a option calls &lsquo;premium&rsquo;.
The options price is decied by 3 factors,</p>
<ol>
<li>underlying stock price</li>
<li>time to expiration</li>
<li>implied volatility</li>
</ol>
<p>The option price is settled by the &lsquo;Black-Scholes formula&rsquo;.
The authors win the Nobel prize for this work.</p>
<p>The most most important factor is the stock price. the higher the stock price the higher the premium.
The more the time left until expiration date the more time value of the option.
The more volatility of the stock means the more probability the stock will have a big move in price.</p>
<p>The difference of bid/ask of option price is called &lsquo;bid/ask spread&rsquo;.
The less the bid/ask spread the better liquidity of the option.</p>
<p>The option premium can also be classfied to intrinsic value and extrinsic value.
The intrinsic value is the value the can be obtained from stock price at expiration date.
The extrinsic value is the value of time and volatility.</p>
<p>if an option price has the intrinsic value, it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;in-the-money&rsquo;(ITM).
if an option price has only the extrinsic value, it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;out-the-money&rsquo;(OTM).
if an option price is close to the stock price (less than one), it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;at-the-money&rsquo;(ATM).</p>
<h1 id="option-greeks">Option greeks <a href="#option-greeks" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>delta: how much the premium change with $1 move of the underlying stock
measures the likelihood of option expired in-the-money
gamma: how much the delta change with $1 move of the underlying stock
theta: how sensitive of the time decay
the closer to the expiration date, the faster of the premium decrease.
the longer to the expiration date, the slower of the premium decrease.</p>
<h1 id="actions-can-happen-before-an-option-expiration">Actions can happen before an option expiration <a href="#actions-can-happen-before-an-option-expiration" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Close: Seller can close the option by buying the option back.
Roll: means 2 actions in one trade, close the current option and open a new option.
Exercise: Buyer can execute the option to buy/sell the underlying stock at strike price.</p>
